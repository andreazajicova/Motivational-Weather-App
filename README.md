This is a React Native app.

## Preview of the App on a mobile phone:

Prerequisities:
## You need to download Expo app onto your phone, which allows you to scan the QR code. 

In the main directory:

## npm i
## npm start

This command will run expo start:

1. It will give you a **QR code** to scan in the Terminal OR Metro Bundler will open on http://localhost:19002/ where you can also scan the QR Code.

2. You can click on **run in the web browser** (but remember this is a mobile native app). 
In this case you don't need to follow the prerequisities. 

3. You can run it on **Android emulator** (for that you need to download **Android Studio** onto your computer and set up an Android device there) or **ois simulator**.
